# SOC-Automation-Lab
# Introduction
The SOC Automation Lab project is a self-contained cybersecurity home lab designed to simulate real-world attack and defense scenarios using open-source tools. It focuses on building hands-on skills in threat detection, log analysis, and automated alertingâ€”key components of a Security Operations Center (SOC).

This lab setup demonstrates how a simulated attacker (Kali Linux) launches various attacks such as Nmap scans and reverse shells against a victim machine (Windows), which in turn forwards logs to a centralized Wazuh SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) server. The Wazuh platform is configured to monitor, detect, and alert on suspicious behavior using custom rules and log-based detections.
